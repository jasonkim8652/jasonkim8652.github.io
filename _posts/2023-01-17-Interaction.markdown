## Introduction

Structure-based drug design seeks to identify and optimize specific attractive interactions between ligands and their host molecules, typiclally proteins, given their 3D structures. This optimization process requires knowledge about interactions of attractive interactions that can be gleaned from crystal structure and associated affinity data. 

Here we compile and review the literature on molecular interactions as it pretrains to medicinal chemistry through a combination of **careful statistical analysis of the large body of publicly available X-ray structure data** (from CSD and PDB)and experimental and theoretical studies of specific model system. 

Throughout this article, we wish to raise the readers' awareness that formulating rules for molecular interactions is only possible within certain boundaries. The combination of 3D structure analysis with binding free energies does not yield a complete understanding of the energetic contributions of individual interactions. While it would be desirable to associate observed interactions with energy terms, we have to accept that molecular interactions behave in a highly nonadditive fashion. The same interaction may be worth different amounts of free energy in different contexts, and it is very hard to find an objective frame of reference for an interaction, since any change of a molecular structure will have multiple effects. 

In reality, the multiplicity of interactions present in a single protein-ligand complex is a compromise of attractive and repulsive interactions that is almost impossible to deconvolute. By focusing on observed interactions, one neglects a large part of the thermodynamic cycle represented by a binding free energy: solvation processes, long-range interactions, conformational changes. Also, crystal structure coordinates give  misleadingly static views of interactions. In reality a macro-  molecular complex is not characterized by a single structure  but by an ensemble of structures. Changes in the degrees of  freedom of both partners during the binding event have a large  impact on binding free energy.
