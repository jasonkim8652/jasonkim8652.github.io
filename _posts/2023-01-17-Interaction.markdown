## Introduction

Structure-based drug design seeks to identify and optimize specific attractive interactions between ligands and their host molecules, typiclally proteins, given their 3D structures. This optimization process requires knowledge about interactions of attractive interactions that can be gleaned from crystal structure and associated affinity data. 

Here we compile and review the literature on molecular interactions as it pretrains to medicinal chemistry through a combination of **careful statistical analysis of the large body of publicly available X-ray structure data** (from CSD and PDB)and experimental and theoretical studies of specific model system. 

Throughout this article, we wish to raise the readers' awareness that formulating rules for molecular interactions is only possible within certain boundaries. The combination of 3D structure analysis with binding free energies does not yield a complete understanding of the energetic contributions of individual interactions. While it would be desirable to associate observed interactions with energy terms, we have to accept that molecular interactions behave in a highly nonadditive fashion. The same interaction may be worth different amounts of free energy in different contexts, and it is very hard to find an objective frame of reference for an interaction, since any change of a molecular structure will have multiple effects. 

In reality, the multiplicity of interactions present in a single protein-ligand complex is a compromise of attractive and repulsive interactions that is almost impossible to deconvolute. By focusing on observed interactions, one neglects a large part of the thermodynamic cycle represented by a binding free energy: solvation processes, long-range interactions, conformational changes. Also, crystal structure coordinates give  misleadingly static views of interactions. In reality a macro-  molecular complex is not characterized by a single structure  but by an ensemble of structures. Changes in the degrees of  freedom of both partners during the binding event have a large  impact on binding free energy.

## General Design Aspects

### Entropic and Enthalpic Components of Binding

Like any other spontaneuos process, a noncovalent binding event takes place only when it is associated with a negative binding free energy. Where crystal structure information exists as well, it is tempting to speculate about the link between thermodynamics and geometery of protein-ligand complexes. A rough correlation between the burial of apolar surface area and free energy could be derived, but beyond that, practically useful relationships between the burial of apolar surface area and free energy relationships between structure and the componenets of free energy have remained elusive. This is not surprising, as both entropy and enthalpy terms obtained from calrimetric experiments contain solute and solvent contributions and thus cannot be interpreted on the basis of structural data alone. 

Furthermore, from an experimental point of view, such studies are very demanding: Error margins are significantly larger than the fitting errors usually reported and depend on subtle details of exeprtimental setup. Entropy and enthalpy values are sensitive to conditions such as salt concentrations and choice of buffer. 

Freire suggested that best-in-class drugs bind to their targets in an enthalpy-driven fashion.[[1]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-387-24532-4_13) His group established a comprehensive ITC data set on HIV pretease inhibitors, concluding that second- and thrid-generation inhibitors, concluding that second- and third-generation inhibitors bind through a strong enthalpy component. One may argue that this could be caused by a higher number of specific backbone interactions, partially replacing the larger lipophilic surface area of the first generation inhibitors, and that the larger reliance on backbone interactions, partially replacing the larger lipophilic surface area of the first generation inhibitors, and that the larger reliance on backbone interactions could be the cause for the broader coverage of HIV protease mutants. Still, even in this data set small structural changes cause large difference in relative $$\Delta H$$ and $$T \Delta S$$ contributions that are hard to explain structurally. Amprenavir and darunavir differ only in one cyclic either moiety, but there is a drastic difference of about 10 Kcal/mol in binding enthalpy between these two ligands. 

Since entropic and enthalpic components of binding are highly dependent on many system-specific properties, the practitioner has to conclude that optimizing for free energy is still the only viable approach to structure-based design. Perhaps the greatest advantage in the attempt to interpret components of $$\Delta G$$ is that it forces us to think about two fundamental topics in unprecedented detail: viewing protein-ligand complexes as flexible entities rather than fixed structures and the role of desolvation effects. These two topics will be dicussed next. 

### Flexibility and Cooperativity

A discussion of the thermodynamics of ligand binding is not complete without metioning the phenomenon of entropy-enthalpy compensation. There is ample evidence of meaningless and spurious correlations between $$\Delta H$$ and $$T \Delta S$$ , often due to far larger variations(sometimes through larger experimental errors) in $$\Delta H$$ than in $$\Delta G$$. Also, compensation is no thermodynamic requirement: If changes in $$\Delta H $$ were always compensated by opposing changes in $$ T \Delta S $$, optimization of binding affinities would hardly be possible. 

Nevertheless, there seems to be a mechanism behind the compensation frequently observed in host-guest chemistry and in protein-ligand interactions. In short, the tighter and more directed an interaction, the lese entropically favorable it is. **Bonding opposes motion, and motion opposes bonding.** However, the detailed nature of these compensatory mechanisms is highly system-dependent and the mechanisms do not obey a single functional form. As a consequence, noncovalent interactions can be positively cooperative; that is, the binding energy associated with there acting together is greater than the sum of the individual binding free energies. Detailed studies by Williams on glycopeptide antibotics indicate that cooperativity may be caused by structural tightening upon introduction of additional interactions; interaction distances become shorter and enthalpically more favorable. Evidence for such effects also exists in protein-protein and protein-ligand complexes.

Hunter has proposed an alternative model of cooperativity. [[2]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074552103002394) Flexible molecules may exist in a series of partially bound states, where not all interactions are made at the same time. Upon introduction of further interactions, the balance shifts toward more frequent formation of the interactions and less mobility. There is experimental evidence for both the structural tightening model and the model of paritally bound states in different systems. Since proteins bind ligands in many geometric arrangements ranging from loosely surface-bound to deeply buried, it is likely that both are valid in different contexts. Ligands with increasingly longer linear and lipophilic side chains have been oberved to bind with increasingly favorable entropies and increasingly unfavorable enthalpies against trypsin and carbonic anhydrase. Longer side chains retain more residual mobility and form less tight (or less frequent) interactions with the protein surface, trading enthalpy for entropy. 

What can we learn from this study? First, small changes in $$ \Delta G $$ often mask large and mutually compensating changes in $$ \Delta H $$ and $$ T \Delta S$$. Focusing on $$\Delta G$$ in designing new molecules is certainly still the safest bet. Second, in medicinal chemistry we often rely on cooperative effects without even noticing, and yet in our minds we attempt to decompose binding free energies into additive elements. There is nothing wrong with this empirical approach as long as we keep in mind that it is primarily useful to teach us about the limits of additivity. The knowledge that specific interactions, in particular strongly directed ones like hydrogen bonds, rididify a protein-ligand complex may help us to exploit cooperativity in a more rational fashion. The Klebe data should also make us think about the degree of mobility required in interactions with different parts of the protein. Flexible domains may require more flexible ligand moiteties than highly ordered ones. The thermodynamic signature of a "good" ligand in not necessarily dominated by an enthalpic term. Our traditional focus on visible interactions and on the induced fit model has led to an overly enthalpic view of the world that neglects flexibility and cooperativity. It also neglects local solvation phenomena, whose details strongly affect the thermodynamic profile of a molecular recognition event. We should learn to incorporate these into our thinking, at least in a qualitative fashion. 

### Desolvation and the Hydrophobic Effect

The classic concept of the hydrophobic efffect is as follows: A hydrophobic solute disrupts the structure of bulk water and decreases entropy because of stronger bonding and ordering of water molecules around the solute. Such disruptions can be minimized if nonpolar solute molecules aggregate. Water then forms one larger "cage" structure around the combined solutes, whose surface area will be smaller than the combined surfaces areas of isolated solutes. This maximizes the amount of free water and thus the entropy. 

If the mechanism were the sole driving force for a protein-ligand interaction, all binding events involving hydrophobic partners would be entropy-driven. But spectroscopic evidence indicates that hydrogen bonds at hydrophobic surfaces are weaker and water molecules more flexible than originally assumed. In addition, already simple water models show that size and surface curvature of solutes have a dramatic impact on their solvation thermodynamics. Complexation thermodynamics driven by enthalpic forces have been regularly observed in host-guest chemistry and have been dubbed the "nonclassical hydrophobic effect". Homans has carefully studied the ligand-binding thermodynamics of the mouse major urinary protein(MUP). THe key to the extermely favorable enthalpy of binding of ligands to MUP seems to be the subomptimal hydration of the binding pocket in the unbound state. The key to the extremely favorable enthalpy of binding of ligands to MUP seems to be the suboptimal hydration of the binding pocket in the unbound state. The negative change in heat capacity upon binding, a hallmark of the hydrophobic effect, is also observed with MUP ligands. It is largely determined by ligand desolvation, with minor contribution form desolvation of the protein. It is quite likely that the synthetic hosts displaying an enthalpy-driven complexation behavior are also incompletely hydrated in the unbound state becuase they typically feature narrow lipophilic clefts not unlike that of MUP. Desolvation costs are also the likely cause why some ligands that seem to fit into a binding site cannot experimentally be confirmed to be inhibitors. 

From these studies it becomes clear that carefully probing the hydration state of a protein binding pocket in the unbound state should be a standard element of structure-based design, as it will likely point out regions where most binding energy can be gained. Failure to match key hydrophobic areas with appropriate ligand moieties can have a severe impact on binding affinity.

Above figure shows that an optimized factor Xa inhibitor is rendered virtually inactive when the key interacting group in the S4 pocket is replaced by hydrogen. Not only does the isopropyl group optimally interact with the S4 pocket but its removal leads to a very unfavorably solvated state of the pocket that is likely the main reason for the dramatic loss of affinity. 

### Structural Water

Any ligand binding event displaces water molecules from the binding site. In structure-based design, most of these are never explicitly considered because they are highly disordered and therefore rarely crystallographically observed. Enzyme  binding sites are in fact characterized by easily displaceable water, as shown by Ringe in her seminal work on transferring protein crystals to organic solvents. &**Those water molecules that are observed need to be carfully analyzed; they might be replaceable or they might be considered as part of the protein structure.**Analyses of high-resolution crystal structures by Poornima and Dean showed that protein-ligand contacts are often binding site and forming multiple hydrogen bonds with both binding partners. Relibase+, a database and query system for analyzing protein-ligand complexes, contains a module that allows a rigorous assessment of water structure in binding sites. 

The release of a water molecule from a rigid environment should be entropically favorable. In a classic contribution, Dunitz has estimated the upper limit of the entropy gain for transferring a water molecule from a protein to water to be 2 kcal/mol at room temperature. To reach the 2 kcal/mol limit, a water molecule will have to be very tightly bound in a rigid protein structure. The entropy gain in releasing the water molecule will then be offset by a loss in enthalpy, and conversely, less tightly bound water molecules might approach or even exceed the entropy in bulk water. It has been observed that even rather tightly bound water molecules can retain a very high amount of residual mobility. Furthermore, protein flexibility may be significnatly affected by water binding. Cases are known where proteins become more rigid or more flexible upon water binding. So how should one assess which water molecules are replaceable? 

Various flavors of molecular dynamcis and free energy calculations have been applied to study this problem. Essex et al., using thermodynamic integration calclations in Monte Carlo simulations, found that the calculated binding free energies for individual water molecules allowed a rough classification into those displaced by ligands and those conserved across protein-ligand complexes; the conserved ones are more tightly bound. Li and Lazaridis computed the thermodynamics of water displacement in concanavalin A- carbohydrate complexes and concluded that "the final outcome of water displacement is sensitive to the details of the binding site and cannot be predicted by simple empirical rules".

Extensive computer simulations are not generally feasible in a fast-paced drug discovery environment, but simple geometric parameters describing the immediate protein environment of a crystallographic water molecule can serve as a usful guide to estimate whether it is displaceable by a ligand moiety. In our hands, a simple geometric rank function based on the distances and angles of neighboring donor and acceptor atoms in the protein, developed by Kellogg and co-workers, has served as a practically useful metric. Water molecules with high ranks should be regarded as part of the binding site. These experience three or more hydrogen bonds with the local environment and are usually located in buried polar cavities. Replacement of an optimally coordinated water molecule will require very high design precision because otherwise the enthalpy loss might be hard to regain. In contrast, displaceable water molecules often participate in a water network without tight binding to the protein. More sloppiness in the desing is allowed in these cases. 

A number of studies allow a direct comparison between a ligand binding to a structural water and a very close analogue displacing it. A nitrile substituent has successfully been used as an isostere of a water hydrogen-bonded to a pyridine0like acceptor nitrogen in EGFR kinase and p38 MAP kinase inhibitors as well as in inhibitors of scytalone dehydratase. In all of these cases affinity was retained or even improved. In peptide inhibitors of iNOS, and amide and an amine functionality were independently replaced by the respective aminoxides and yielded equipotent inhibitors replacing a water molecule bound by the heme carboxylates. In all of these cases no more than two hydrogen bonds are formed between protein and water, indiciating nonideal coordination. Campiani et al. reported an instructive counterexample. They attempted to replace a water molecule in acetylcholinesterase by derivatives of huperzine and observed a dramatic loss in affintiy. The designed phenol ligands clearly would nor reach the position of the water, which in addition is firmly coordinated by three hydrogen bonds to the protein. 

![fig2](https://jasonkim8652.github.io/assets/images/Interactions_2.PNG)

The binding site of PDE10 contains two buried water molecules that are hydrogen-bonded to each other and to two and three protein residues, respectively. This high coordination suggest a large enthalpic penalty for the removal of any of these. We found that the water molecule with almost ideal tetrahedral coordination has not been displaced by any known PDE10 ligand, while 1 out of 15 different inhibitor series was able to expel the less tightly bound water molecule. 

Wherever possible, a comparison between water placements in multiple independently solved crystal structures should be made to minimize errors during the modeling of water sites in the refinement process. Strongly bound water molecules are often conserved across multiple crystal structures. Alternatively, water sites have been predicted computationally through MD simulations or empirical functionals. An increasingly important area of investigation is the analysis of entire water clusters. Understanding the hydration properties of subpockets within binding sites can be the key to understanding ligand bindings, as exemplified by research on the OppA protien. Crystal structure of complexes between OppA and peptides of the general structure Lys-X-Lys reveal that certain water molecules adopt the same position independently of the nature of residue X. The strength of the interactions between these water molecules can help explian the binding affinities of the OppA-peptide complexes. tRNA-guanine transglycosylase is another protein wn which a conserved water cluster has been carefully studied. Achieving a more general understanding of the properties of water clusters is a challenge for the future. For example, ring shaped water clusters seem to be prominent in outer hydration spheres and perhaps in purely hydrophobic binding pockets, as they benefit from cooperativity of their hydrogen bonds. 

### Repulsive Interactions

An important element of the design process is the analysis of repulsive interactions one may have artificially generated upon modifying experimentally determined coordinates of a complex in silico. This is even more critical if part of the protein is treated as flexible during a minimization step, since locally introduced strain can be absorbed by other parts of the structure and can be dissipated to such an extent that it becomes unrecognizable. It is therefore advisible to keep the protein rigid with the exception of only those parts that are known to adapt to ligands or to create alternative hypothetical low-energy states of a protein that are then kept fixed in the design process. The availability  of multiple crystal structures of the same protein with different ligands is most useful here, as their overlays allow the identification of backbone movements and flexible side chains. Severe repulsive interactions are not observed in nature, so distances significantly below the shortest experimentally observed ones are to be avoided. General steric fit can be assessed through surface depictions of both binding partners. In addition, one may rely on general molecular mechanics terms or simple van der Waals distance criteria to analyze steric clashes. Conformations should be carefully checked; force field minimization often has the effect of acheiving a good interaction at the expense of a strained torsion angle. Torsion angles are the softest conformation parameters and yer have the largest effects on geometry.
