## Motivation
Since retrosynthesis problem in lead optimization compound is too hard to solve in computer, I tried to make a model that could make a synthesizable Leadoptimization library. This paper is about constructing synthesizable molecule genertive model. There are actually three ways to solve this problem.

1. Making a virtual library with building blocks and Reaction templates exhaustively.
2. Making a virtual library with building blocks and Reaction templates using RL(focusing on specific molecules).
3. Using a molecule generative model to build virtual library.

First method is too exhaustive: we do not need to make a compounds that is not similar to hit compound. Second method also has problem. Even though we apply RL while building virtual library to make a compounds that is similar to hit compound, it is hard to apply RL because of large action space; There are almost infinite number of combination of reactants and reactions which makes determining next step hard. These are the reason why we need to use thrid method, using molecule generative model. It also does not require us to construct building block library. 

Our objective in this paper is as following below. For a given scaffold s, the library is a set of molecules with the following conditions. 1. All include same scaffold 2. All molecules are accessible by the same sequence of synthetically relevant chemical transformation. 

## Method

### Model Overview

![model architecture](https://jasonkim8652.github.io/assets/images/Libinvent_1.jpg){: .center}

Prior model is RNN model which get scaffold smiles as input and results in a proposed molecules. RL model updates parameter in prior model using score function and diversity filter. 

### Dataset

Compounds are from the publicly available ChEMBL27. First step of the data preparation process involves data purging and sanitization by removing the compounds that does not satisfies Lipinski's rule of 5 or having rare token. Following below is their statistics about token.
