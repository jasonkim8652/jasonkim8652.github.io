## Intoduction
  
TCRs typically engage antigen-MHC complexes via one or more of their six complementarity-determining loops(CDRs), three contributed by each chain of the TCR dimer. However, cost and experimental limitations have restricted the available databases to just a minute fraction of the possible sample space of TCR-antigen binding pairs. As we discuss later, these data sets are also poorly representative of the univers of self and pathogenic epitopes and of the varied MHC contexts in which they may be presented. 

The research community has therefore turned to machine learning models as a means of predicting the antigen specificity of the so-called orphan TCRs having no known experimentally validated cognate antigen. Accurate prediction of TCR_antigen specificity can be described as deriving computational solutions to two related problems below:

1. given a TCR of unknown antigen specificity, which antigen-MHC complexes is it most likely to bind
2. given an antigen-MHC complex, which are the most likely cognate TCRs?

These should cover both 'seen' pairs included in the data on which the model was trained and novel or 'unseen' TCR-epitope pairs to which the models has not been exposed. Impressive advances have been made for specificity have been identified for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2, providing possible avenues for new vaccine and pharmaceutical development. However, performance for seen epitopes wanes beyond a small number of immunodominant viral epitopes and is generally poor for unseen eptiopes. This matters because many epitopes encountered in nature will not have an experimentally validated cognate TCR, particularly those of human or non-viral origin.

We must also make an important distinction between the related tasks of predicting TCR specificity and antigen immunogenicity. The former is the prediction of binding between sets of TCRs and antigen-MHC complexes. The latter can be described as predicting whether a given antigen will include a functional T cell immune response: a complex chain of events spanning antigen expression, processing and presentation, TCR binding, T cell activation, expansion and effector differentiation. A significant gap also remains for the prediction of T cell activation for a given peptide, and the paramteres that influence pathological peptide or neoantigen immunogenecity remain under intense investigation. We believe that only by integrating knowledge of antigen presentation, TCR recognition, context-dependent activatetion and effector function at the cell and tissue level will we fully realize the benefits to fundamental and translational science. 

## State of the art

We now explore some of the experimental and computational progress made to date, highlighting possible explanations for why generalizable prediction of TCR binding specificity remains a daunting task. 

### Experimental methods

The development of recombinant antigen-MHC multimer assays has proved transformative in the analysis of TCR-antigen specificity, enabling researchers to track and study T cell populations under various conditions and disease settings. Nonetheless, critical limitations remain that hamper high-throughput determination of TCR-antigen specificity.

Antigen-MHC multimers may be used to determine TCR specificity using bulk(pooled) T cell populations, or newer single-cell methods. Bulk methods are widely used and relatively inexpensive, but do not provide information on $\alpha \beta$ TCR chain pairing or function. As a result, single chain TCR sequences predominate in public data sets. 

However, both $\alpha$-chains and $\beta$-chains contribute to antigen recognition and specificity. Multimodal single-cell technologies provide insight into chain pairing and transcriptomic and phenotypic profiles at cellular resolution, but remain prohibitively expensive, return fewer TCR sequences per run than bulk experiments and show significant bias towards TCRs with high specificity. The appropriate experimental protocol for the reduction of nonspecific multimer binding, validation of correct folding and computational improvement of signal-to-noise ratios remain active fiedls of debate. 

Although bulk and single-cell methods are limeted to a modest number of antigen-MHC complexes per run, the advent of technologies such as lentiviral transfections assays provides scalability to up to 96 antigen-MHC complexes through library-on-library screens. However, previous knowledge of the antigen-MHC complexes of interest is still required. This precludes epitope discovery in unkonw, rare, sequestered, non-canonical and/or non-protein antigens. 

The advent of synthetic peptide display libraries permits the extension of binding analysis to hundreds of thousands of peptides per TCR. Using transgenic yeast expressing synthetic peptide-MHC constructs from a library of $2 X 10^8$ peptides, Birnbaum et al. dissected the binding preferences of autoreactive mouse and human TCRs, providing clues as to the mechanisms underlying autoimmune targeting in multiple sclerosis. High-throughput library screens such as these provide opportunities for improved screening of the antigen-MHC space, but limit analysis to individual TCRs and rely on TCR-MHC binding instead of function. There remains a need for high-throughput linkage of antigen specificity and T cell function, for example, through mammalia or bead display. 

As a result of these barriers to scalability, only a minuscule fraction of the total possible sample space of TCR-antigen pairs has been validated experimentally. Where the HLA context of a given antigen is known, the training data are dominated by antigens presented by a handful of common alleles. Many antigens have only one known cognate TCR. These limitations have simultaneously provided the motivation for and the greatest barrier to computational methods for the prediction fo TCR-antigen specificity.

### Computational methods. 

A comprehensive survey of computational models for TCR specificity inference is beyond the scope intended here but can be found in the following helpful review. Broadly speaking, current models can be divided into two categories, which we dub supervised predicitive models(SPMs) and unsupervised clustering models(UCMs) on accounting of their respective use of supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

#### Supervised predictive models

SPMs are those which attempt to learn a function that will correctly predict the cognate epitope for a given input TCR of unknown specificity, given some training data set of known TCR-peptide pairs. Perfomance by this measure surpasses 80 % ROC-AUC for a handful of 'seen' immunodominant viral epitopes presented by MHC class I. However, representation is not a gurantee of performance: 60% ROC-AUC has been reported for HLA-A2*01-CMV-NLVPMVATV, possibly owing to the recognition of this immunodominant antigen by diverse TCRs. Critically, few models explicitly evaluate the performance of trained predictors on unseen epitopes using comparable data sets. 

Together, these results highlight a critical need for a thorough, independent benchmarking study conducted across models on data sets prepared and analysed in a consistent manner. Until then, newer models may be applied with reasonable confidence by common HLA alleles. However, SPMs should be used with caution when generalizing to prediction of any epitope, as performance is likely to drop the further the epitope is in sequence form those in the training set. 

#### Unsupervised clustering models

Unlike SPMs, UCMs do not depend on the availability of labelled data, learning instead to produce groupings of the TCR, antigen or HLA input that reflect the underlying statistical variations of the data. Applied to TCR repertoires, UCMs take as their input single or paired TCR CDR3 amino acid sequences, with or without gene usage information, and return a mapping of sequences to unique clusters. clustering is achieved by determining the similarity between input sequences, using either 'hand-crafted'features, or by comparing abstract features learnt by DNNs. 

Clustering provides multiple paths to specificity inference for orphan TCRs. Epitope specificity can be predicted by assuming that if an unlabelled TCR is similar to a receptor of known specificity, it will bind the same epitope. One may also co-cluster unlabelled and labelled TCRs and assign the modal or most enriched epitope to all seqeunces that cluster together. Finally, DNNs can be used to generate 'protein fingerprints', simple fixed-length numerical representations of complex variable input seqeucnes that may serve as a direct input for a second supervised model. 

As for SPMs, quantitative assessment of the relative merits of hand-crafted and neural network-based UCMs for TCR specificity inference remains limited to the proponents of each new model. Altough some DNN-UCMs allow for the integration of paired chain sequences and even transcriptomic profiles, they are susceptible to the same training biases as SPMs and are notably less easy to implement than established clustering models such as GLIPH and TCRdist. However, these established clustering models scale relatively poorly to large data sets compared with newer releases. Recent analyses suggest that there is little to differentiate commonly used UCMs from simple sequence distance measures. Here again, independent benchmarking analyses would be valuable, work towards which our group is dedicating significant time and effort. 

## Key challenges

Among the most plausible explanations for these failures are limitations in the data, methodological gaps and incomplete modelling of the underlying immunology. 

### Data

As we have set out earlier, the single most significant limitation to model development is the availability of high-quality TCR and antigen-MHC pairs. The need is most acute for under-represented antigens, for those presented by less frequent HLA alleles, and for linkage of eptiope specificity and T cell function. Meanwhile, single-cell multimodal technologies have given rise to hundreds of millions of unlabellled TCR sequences, linked to transcriptomics, phenotypic and functional information. However, these unlabelled data are not without significant limitations. Notably, biological factors such as age, sex, ethnicity and disease setting vary between studies and are likely to influence immune repertories. Differences in experimental protocol, sequence pre-processing, total variation filtering(denoising) and normalization betwen laboratory groups are also likely to have an impact: * batch correction may well need to be applied. *

### Modelling

We believe that several critical gaps must be addressed before a solution to generalized epitope specificity inference can be realized. 

First, models whose TCR sequence input is limited to the use of $\beta$-chain CDR3 loops and VDJ gene codes are only ever likely to tell part of the story of antigen recognition, and the extent to which single chain pairing is sufficient to describe TCR-antigen specificity remains an open question. Although CDR3 loops may be primarily responsible for antigen recognition, residues from CDR1, CDR2 and even teh framework region of both $\alpha$-chains and $\beta$-chains may be involved. Subtle compensatory changes in interaction networks between peptide-MHC and TCR, altered binding modes and conformational flexibility in both TCR and MHC may underpin TCR cross-reactivity. The advent of automated protein structure prediction with software programs such as RoseTTAFold, ESM FOld and AlphaFold-MUltimer provide potential opportunities for large-scale sequence and structure interpretations of TCR eptiope specificity. 

This has been illustrated in a recent preprint in which a modified version of AlphaFold-Multimer has been used to identify the most likely binder to a given TCR, achieving a mean ROC-AUC of 82% on a small pool of eight seen epitopes. [[1]](https://elifesciences.org/articles/82813) To train models, balanced sets of negative and positive samples are required. In the absence of experimental negatives, negative instances may be produced by shuffling or drawing randomly from healthy donor repertoires. However, these approaches assume, on the other hand, that TCRs do not cross-react and, on the other hand, that the healthy donor repertoires do not include sequences reactive to the epitopes of interest. A recent study from Jiang et al. [[2]](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513029v1.abstract) provides interesting strategies to address this challenge. 

Finally, developers should use the increasing volume of functionally anntoated orphan TCR data to boost performance through transfer learning. The best-performing configuration of TITAN made used a TCR module tht had been pretrained on a BindingDB database of 471,017 protein-ligand pairs. Incorporating evolutionary and structural information through sequences and structure-aware representations of the TCR and of the antigen-MHC complex may yield further benefits. 

### Immunology

It is now evident that the underlying immunological correlates of T cell interaction with their cognate ligands are highly variable and only partially understood, with critical consequences for model design. Importantly, TCR-antigen specificity inference is just one part of the large puzzle of antigen immunogenicity prediction, which we condense into three phases: antigen processing and presentation by MHC, TCR recognitio and T cell response. 

Computational models for predicting peptide binding affinity to some MHC alleles, especially class I HLAs, have achieved near perfect ROC-AUC, for common alleles. However, this problem is far from solved, particularly for less-freqeunt MHC class I alleles and for MHC class II alales. 

TCRs are at once specific for antigens bearing particular motifs and capable of considerable promiscuity. This contradiction might be explaiend through specific interaction of conserved 'hotspot' residues in the TCR CDR loops with corresponding two to three residue clusters in the antigen, balanced by a greater tolerance of variations in amino acids at other positions. Despite the known potential for pormiscuity in the TCR, the pre-processing stages of many models assum that a given TCR has only one cognate epitope. Another under-explored yet highly relevant factor of T cell recognition is the impact of positive and negative thymic selection and more specifically the effect of self-peptide presentation information of the naive immune repertorie. Many predictors are trained using epitopes from the Immune Epitope Database labelled with readouts from single time points. However, Achar et al.[[3]](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abl5311) illustrated that integrating cytokine responses over time improved prediction of quality. Antigen load and affinity can also play important roles. Our view is that, although T cell-independent predictors of immunogenicity have clear translational benefits, only after we can dissect the relative contribution of the three stages described ealier will we understand what determines antigen immunogenicity. 

Integrating TCR sequence and cell-specific covariates from single-cell data has been shown to improve performance in the inference of T cell antingen specificity. By taking a graph theoretical approach, Schattgen et al. [[4]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-00989-2) reported an assocation between clonotype clustering with the cellular phenotypes derived from gene expression and surface marker expression. We believe that such integrative approaches will be instrumental in unlocking the secrets of T cell antigen recognition. 

## Conclusions and call to action

We believe that by harnessing the massive volume of unlabelled TCR sequences emerging from single-cell data, applying data augmentation techniques to counteract epitope and HLA imbalances in labelled data, incorporating sequece and structure-aware features and applyring cutting edge computational techniques based on rich functional and binding data, improvements in generalizable TCR-antigen specificity inference are within our collective grasp. To aid in this effort, we encourage the following efforts from the community. 

First, a consolidated and validated library of labelled and unlabelled TCR data should be made available to facilitate model pretraining and systematic comparisons. Second, a coordinated effort should be made to improve the coverage of TCR-antigen pairs presented by less common HLA allels and non-viral epitopes. Third, an independent, unbiased and systematic evaluation of model performance across SPMs, UCMs and combinations of the two would be of grat use to the community.
