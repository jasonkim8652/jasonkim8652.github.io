## Intrdocution

Altough it is possible to infer protein complex structure from primary sequence information alone, in many cases, the three-dimensional structures of constituent(unbound) chains have already been experimentally determined. Moreover, extra infromation such as target binding sites or inter-chain contacts, is readily available in many applications, or can be derived through experimental methods such as cross-linking mass spectrometry. In these scenarios, pretoein docking methods can be used to predict a complex structure. Despite having many practical applications, the efficacy of in silico protein docking or design methods is ultimately hindered by unrealistic assumptions about input structures, and failure to effectively utilize PPI information such as binding sites and inter-protein contacts. 

Current computational methods for protein docking and design typically impose backbone and side-chain rigidity constraints and are trained to utilize specific side-chain interactions or protein backbone placements derived from native complexes which are already optimal for binding. In addition to overlooking conformational flexibility, current methods tend to either ignore or ineffectively incorporate PPI information. For many applications, it is important to consider interactions as targeting catalytic sites of enzymes, or designing therapeutics to block a specific protein-protein interaction. In most cases, PPIs such as binding sites or inter-chain contacts are utilized only as a post-processing step, to re-rank or filter out incompatible predictions.

In this work, we introduce DockGPT, an end-to-end deep-learning approach to site-specific flexible docking and desing. In developing DockGPT, we hypothesized that neural networks could accurately recover protein 3D-coordinates from coarse or incompleate descriptions of their geometry. After affirming this capability, we approached flexible docking in a manner analogous to matrix completion followed by multidimensional scaling. In the matrix completion step, missing entries loosely correspond to inter-chain quantities such as distance and orientation. The imputed representation is then converted to 3D geometry in order to recover the bound complex. This framing allows us to naturally incorporate PPI information as input, in the form of residue-level binding interfaces or interfacial contacts. In addition, removing some intra-chain geomtery allows us to simultaneously dock and design protein sgements, while still targeting speicific binding sites.
