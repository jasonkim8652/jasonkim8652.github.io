## Introduction

Accordingly, the definition of class I and class II allele-specific MHC binding motifs allowed identification of regions within a protein that have the potential of binding particular MHC alleles. A variety of assays to detect and quantitate the affinity of peptide-MHC binding have also been established, and the threshold of affinity associated with generation of immune responses has also been elucidated. THus, by a combination of motif searches and MHC-peptide binding assays, potential candidates for epitope-based vaccines can now be identificed rapidly and accurately.

The eptiope approach also allows focusing of immune responses against multiple conserved epitopes, a factor of crucial importance in the case of rapdily mutating pathogens. By combining epitopes derived from multiple antigens into a single immunogen, it might be possible to overcome the limited capacity of certain delivery systems. By the same strategy, It is also possible to guard against low efficacy due to a lack or loss of antigen expression, a factor of importance when a single protein antigen is targeted for vaccine development. Furthermore, epitope based vaccines can also be ananlogued to increase potency and break tolerance, as highlighted by a number of different studies.

In parallel, recent evidenc has been provided to validate the epitope approach for treatment and/or prevention of numerous different types of diseases. In conclusion, our understanding of the role played by specific residues in the presentation peptide eptiopes by class I and class II HLA molecules has greatly advanced in teh past several years. A body of knowledge enhancing the ability to identify and desing peptides that bind across many HLA types has emerged, and could greatly facilitate the development of vaccines for the prevention and treatment of important infectious diseases or neoplasias.

## The discovery of HLA-A2-, -A3-, and -B7-supertypes: a quick review

The large degree of HLA polymorphism is a factor to be taken into account in the development of epitope-based vaccines. To address this factor, epitope selection ecompassing identification of peptides capable of binding multiple HLA molecules can be utilized. Our studies have identified several HLA supermotifs, each of which corresponds to the ability of peptide ligands to bind several different HLA alleles. The HLA alleleic variant s that bind peptides possessing a particular HLA super-motif are collectively referred to as an HLA supertype.

Early studeis defined the motifs recognized by some of the mose common HLA types. It was found that HLA-A\* 0301 and -A\*1101 recognized very similar motifs, leading to the hypothesis that a significant overlap might exist amongst their peptide binding repretoires. This was verified soon. This group of alleles, characterized by similar peptide specificity, was defined as the A3-supertype. Similarly, a significant overlap in peptide binding repertories was demonstrated amongst several serologically distinct HLA-B alleles (B*0702, B*3501, B*5101, B*5301, and B*5401) and amongst different A2-subtypes. It has also been noted that various HLA-B alleles share a main anchor specificity that overlaps with that of HLA-B*44. This work resulted in the definition of the B7-, A2-, and B44-supertypes.

The A2-supertype includes, A\*0201, A\*0202, A\*0203, A\*0204, A\*0205, A\*0206, A\*0207, A\*6802, A\*6901. These alleles recognize peptides of about 9 or 10 residues in length which bear small or aliphatic hydrophobic residues (L,I,V,M,A,T, or Q) at position 2 and L,I,V,M,A,or T at the C- terminal position. The B pocket of A2-supertype molecules is characterized by a consensus motif including residues $F/Y_9, M_{45}, E/N_{63}, K/N_{66}, V_{67}, H/Q_{70}, and Y/C_{99}$. Similarly, the A2-supertypes F pocket is characterized by a consensus motif including residues $D_{77}, T_{80}, L_{81}, Y_{116}$.
