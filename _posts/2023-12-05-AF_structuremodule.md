### Gram-Schmidt Process

Gram-schmidt process is a method to orthonormalize the set of vectors to make a basis set of inner product space. We could make any vector into orthogonal set of vector, which is linearly independent. We could use projection to make this set. Further information is available in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram–Schmidt_process).

### Quaternion

Quaternion is similar to rotation matrix, but it is much more 

### Equivariant vs Invariant

# Overview

# Construction of frames from ground truth atom positions

# Invariant point attention(IPA)

# Backbone update

# Compute all atom coordinates

# Rename symmetric ground truth atoms

# Amber relaxation
